Aims to fully build the Skeuomorphic/Frutiger Aero beauty into the Mozilla Firefox ESR Releases (Currently, 115) interface, and make computing **productive** and **fun**, once again.

<ins>**Disclaimer**</ins>: 

 This theme was built to look best with the Windows 7 Aero user interface.
 Windows 10 builds might get **tested** for accuracy in the future, though.
