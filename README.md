# FrutigerFX
Aims to fully build the Skeuomorphic/Frutiger Aero beauty into the Mozilla Firefox ESR Releases (Currently, 115) interface, and make computing **productive** and **fun**, once again.

**Disclaimer**: 

 This theme was built to look best with the Windows 7 Aero user interface.
 Windows 10 builds might be get **tested** for accuracy in the future, though.
            
**Installation**:

->Put the defaults folder and config.js file in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox

->And the chrome folder in %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(Your default Firefox profile)

->DON'T forget to delete startupCache folder under C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(Your default Firefox profile)

->Enable 'compact mode' under toolbar density
