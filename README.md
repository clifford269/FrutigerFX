Aims to fully build the Skeuomorphic/Frutiger Aero beauty into the Mozilla Firefox ESR Releases (Currently, 115) interface, and make computing **productive** and **fun**, once again.

<ins>**Disclaimer**</ins>: 

 This theme was built to look best with Windows Aero Glass transparency.

**Features**:

1. Aero user interface across all Windows versions.
2. Aero hover effect on context menus; Windows 7/Vista scrollbars: on Windows 10+ systems as well.
3. Better User Experience compared to vanilla Firefox or any other Firefox theme, owing to better legibility, colour and contrast.
4. The UI is **pleasing** and **fun** to work with.
5. The project means to build, restore and **uphold** user-centric and user-pleasing UI design practices.

**Donate** here to support the project:
