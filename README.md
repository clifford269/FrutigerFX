# FrutigerFX
Aims to fully build the Windows/Frutiger Aero coolness into the Mozilla Firefox ESR 115 interface, and make computing fun once again.

Disclaimer: 1. This theme was build to look best with the Windows 7 Aero user interface.

            2. You might encounter bugs/issues. You are encouraged to discover them and they might get corrected with time.
               
->Put the defaults folder and config.js file in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox
->And the chrome folder in %appdata%/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/<Your default Firefox profile>

Acknowledgements:
1. Aris-t2's css and js scripts proved to be a good customisable base.
2. Khang-ndâ€™s reproduction of the Windows 7 UI elements proved beneficial for learning to craft glossy Aero interfaces.
3. Microsoft, for their awesome Icons (in the past).
