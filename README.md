            2. You might encounter bugs/issues.
               You are encouraged to discover them and they might get corrected with time.

1. Aris-t2's css and js scripts proved to be a good customisable base.
2. Khang-ndâ€™s reproduction of the Windows 7 UI elements proved beneficial for learning to craft glossy Aero interfaces.
