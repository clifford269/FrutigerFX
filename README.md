Aims to fully build the Skeuomorphic/Frutiger Aero beauty into the Mozilla Firefox ESR Releases (Currently, 115) interface, and make computing **productive** and **fun**, once again.

<ins>**Disclaimer**</ins>: 

 This theme was built to look best with Windows Aero Glass transparency.

**Features**:

1. Aero user interface across all Windows versions.
2. Aero hover effect on context menus; Windows 7/Vista style scrollbars, buttons, menus and toolbars and more: on Windows 10+ systems as well.
3. Better User Experience compared to vanilla Firefox or any other Firefox theme, owing to better legibility, colour and contrast.
4. Skeuomorphism prevails—icons, fun gradients and more.
5. The UI is **pleasing** and **fun** to work with.
6. The project means to build, restore and **uphold** user-centric and user-pleasing UI design practices.

This project is the work of a single individual and relies on your support. Please **Donate** here: <p align="center">
